- Review [D31465 - Make libglvnd a LIB_DEPEND in various usages](https://reviews.freebsd.org/D31465)
    - Need to make sure the dependencies are sane after this change
    - Manu should review to make sure things are the right way around
    - mesa-devel and mesa-libs switches from having a build dependency to library dependency
    - Need to do poudriere bulk to make sure things build and there's no surprise dependencies
    - Seems like it might be OK, but there's a number of non-obvious issues manu@ will want to comment on as to why it's the way it is today.
- xorg update still pending... team is on European Holiday
- Patch for nvidia driver Danfe is taking care of [257456](https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=257456)
